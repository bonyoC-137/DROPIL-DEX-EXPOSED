### The truth behind the "trading bot" called Dex and the **Dropil Team** .<br>

`("Truth" is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality)`

### What was Dex (the Lie) ?<br>

_( according to the white paper and why all the people invest in the platform )_<br>

![](assets/README-450ec01a.png)<br>
![](assets/README-10ba05ef.png)<br>
![](assets/README-3ced58a7.png)<br><br>
The Dropil team stated that had collected "_50 millions $_" from the ICO. Which "_50 millions dollars_" will fund "the trading bot" **Dex**.<br>
![](assets/README-73b0c63d.png)<br><br><br>
Dex would aggregate all the investors funds, giving massive advantage to trades ? Trading on the Binance exchange ?<br>
![](assets/README-b9c645c3.png)<br>
_Sufficient capital to allow maximum diversification_ ? the 50 mil $ from the ICO ?<br><br><br>
![](assets/README-1e23556b.png)<br><br><br>

## What was Dex in reality ?<br>

_( - Vision, hallucination, phantasm, fraud, sham, falsify, charlatan - )_<br>

![](assets/README-d5e0dda0.png)<br>
<br>
![](assets/README-24c87cad.png)<br>
Dex was NEVER profitable!<br>
So there wasn't a "trading bot", and everything about that Dropil team can **create** or **CODE** a _trading bot was a lie !_<br>
<br>
You can find video clips of Zachary Matar on YouTube presenting Dex, pushing "the manipulation" that it was real.<br>
But this just shows _Dropil_ true nature !<br>
The true nature of the people behind this fraud.<br>
<br>

Do you think that the trading bot called **Jade** _is real ?_ , oh please, think again...<br>
We will get there !<br><br><br>
<br>
![](assets/README-6a905309.png)<br>
In reality, and proven by facts - **Dex NEVER traded on Binance**.<br>
Aren't you already asking yourself, but how is this possible ?<br>
<br>
For the people, being lied since the beginning of this sham project will be hard to acknowledge **the Truth**.<br><br>

You have to get to know the Dropil team a bit better to understand why this is very, very possible and absolutely real.<br><br>

### Dropil and its founders claimed that Dex would generate profits that would be distributed to investors.<br>

![](assets/README-398fc2d8.png)<br>
Only with a single product ? This single product **_the trading Bot - Dex_** ! WoW ! Amazing !<br>
<br>
And Sadly i have to share my opinion, that until now as a "ex investor" in Dropil sham(project-platform), that no matter how many products they produce and knowing what they have produced already, any positive outcome is under BIG Question mark "?" and only go-in if you are one lucky Pro-Trader dude and you are willing to test your trading abilities against them.<br>
<br>

### In reality, the sale of DROPs during the ICO phase raised less than $1.9 million, not the $54 million claimed.<br>

<br>
![](assets/README-73b0c63d.png)

### The Dropil team constantly deleting and covering its tracks.<br>

They are still trying to keep this fiasco up and going. You will ask but how is that possible after so many evidence and facts ? Even the SEC is currently investigating them and fighting them in court, how is this possible ?<br>
<br>
On 28 feb 2020 the "trading bot" called Dex vanished from this world, like a ghost...<br>

<br>
<br>
But even now, if We login to the Dex portal.<br>
Dex seems to be still active and actively trading something, somewhere !<br>
Dex never stops !<br>
Even without any funds !<br>
Even without being on exchanges !<br>
Even without making any trades !<br>
This is what we should call a real "Technology".<br>
![](assets/README-cee8cad3.png)<br>
**Dex is a unstoppable force and Nobody cant stop it !**<br>
**Dex just keeps trading !**<br>
Even the SEC does not have jurisdiction over the trading that Dex is doing !<br>
