### The truth behind the "trading bot" called Dex and the **Dropil Team** .<br>

`("Truth" is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality)`

### What was Dex ?<br>

_( according to the white paper and why all the people invest in the platform )_<br>

<br>
the Dropil team stated that has collected _54 millions $_ after the ICO was over.<br>
Which _54 millions dollars_ will fund "the trading bot" Dex.<br>

**_"sufficient capital to allow maximum diversification"_** !!!<br>

## What was Dex in reality ?<br>

_( - Vision, hallucination, phantasm, fraud, sham, falsify, charlatan - )_<br>

![](assets/README-24c87cad.png)<br>
Dex was NEVER profitable! So there wasn't a "trading bot", everything about that they can create, code a trading bot was a lie !<br>
You can find video clips of Zachary Matar on youtube presenting that Des is real, but this was just showing _Dropil team_ true nature.<br>
(Do you think that the other trading bot Jade is real ? , think again... We will get there !)<br>

Dex NEVER traded on Binance ? wtf ?

### Dropil and its founders claimed that Dex would generate profits that would be distributed to investors as additional DROPs every 15 days.<br>

![](assets/README-e932bbc6.png)<br>
![](assets/README-398fc2d8.png)<br>
<br><br>

### In reality, the sale of DROPs during the ICO phase raised less than $1.9 million, not the $54 million claimed.<br>

![](assets/README-73b0c63d.png)

### The Dropil team constantly deleting and covering its tracks.<br>

They are still trying to keep this fiasco up and going. You will ask but how is that possible after so many evidence and facts ? Even the SEC is currently investigating them and fighting them in court, how is this possible ?<br><br>
On 28 feb 2020 the "trading bot" called Dex vanished from this world, like a ghost...<br>
